# Codex Pet

A minimal VS Code extension, in the spirit of [vscode-pets](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets),
that plays a [Codex pet](https://codexpets.org/) sprite sheet in its own
Activity Bar side panel.

## Status

Loads any pet that follows the Codex v2 pet spec (`pet.json` + `spritesheet.webp`)
from the bundled `pets/<pet-id>/` folder, plus any pet dropped into the
user pets folder (see **Codex Pet: Open Pets Folder** below) — that folder
lives outside the extension install directory, so pets you add there survive
extension updates/reinstalls. Multiple pets can be present at once — pick
which one loads via command or setting (see below). A user pet with the same
id as a bundled one takes precedence. If no pet is found, or its spritesheet
fails to load, the pet renders as a placeholder blob so the
movement/animation logic is still visible.

## Commands

- **Codex Pet: Reveal Pet View** (`codexPet.start`) — opens/focuses the
  Activity Bar view. The pet(s) shown are resolved from `codexPet.selectedPets`
  (if non-empty), then `codexPet.selectedPet`, then the last pet(s) picked via
  "Choose Pets...", or the only pet if there's just one. If none of those
  resolve and multiple pets exist, prompts with a picker.
- **Codex Pet: Choose Pets...** (`codexPet.choosePets`) — shows a multi-select
  picker and switches the view to the chosen pet(s) immediately, remembering
  the choice for next time. How many you can select at once is gated by your
  highest-level pet: 1 pet slot by default, a 2nd unlocks at level 5, a 3rd at
  level 15, a 4th at level 30 — locked slots are shown in the picker (🔒) so
  the next unlock is visible before it's reachable. `codexPet.choosePet` still
  works as an alias for this command.
- **Codex Pet: Open Pets Folder** (`codexPet.openPetsFolder`) — reveals your
  persistent user pets folder in Finder/Explorer (creating it if needed), so
  you can drop in a new pet folder that survives extension updates.
- **Codex Pet: Install Claude Code Hooks...** (`codexPet.installClaudeCodeHooks`)
  — adds the hooks described below to `~/.claude/settings.json` (with a
  confirmation dialog first). Safe to re-run: it only adds hooks that aren't
  already there, and never touches unrelated hooks you've configured.

## Reacting to Claude Code activity

If `claude-code` is listed in `codexPet.aiActivitySources` (it is by
default), the pet plays a "busy" animation (the `review` sprite state) with a
small speech bubble while Claude Code is actively working, and returns to
normal idle/walk behavior once it's done. The bubble shows what it's doing
when available — the current tool name (e.g. "Bash", "Edit") during tool use,
or "Thinking" while a prompt is being processed.

Separately, whenever one or more Claude Code sessions need something from you
— finished responding and waiting on a prompt, or blocked on a permission
dialog — a small red count badge appears on the pet; hovering it shows which
session(s) are waiting, labeled with the session's first prompt (truncated to
60 chars) if available, falling back to the workspace folder name otherwise —
there's no real "chat title" to read from Claude Code, so the first prompt is
the closest stand-in.

This works by watching per-session status files under
`~/.codex-pet/sessions/` (one JSON file per session, e.g.
`claude-code-<session-id>.json`, containing `{ "source", "state": "busy" |
"waiting", "updatedAt": <ms>, "label": <string | null>, "cwd": <string |
null>, "title": <string | null> }`). A `busy` status older than 30s is treated as stale and ignored, so
a crashed session can't leave the pet stuck animating. A `waiting` status can
sit for much longer before being dropped (default 15 minutes, via
`codexPet.waitingStaleMinutes`) since a session can legitimately wait on a human
for a long time — this timeout only exists to eventually clean up sessions
that crashed after finishing a response but before ending.

Claude Code reports into these files via its
[hooks](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) mechanism. The
first time the extension activates with hooks missing, it offers to install
them for you; you can also trigger this anytime via **Codex Pet: Install
Claude Code Hooks...**, or do it by hand by adding to
`~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.codex-pet/report-status.sh claude-code busy" }] }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.codex-pet/report-status.sh claude-code busy Thinking" }] }],
    "Notification": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.codex-pet/report-status.sh claude-code waiting" }] }],
    "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.codex-pet/report-status.sh claude-code waiting" }] }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.codex-pet/report-status.sh claude-code end" }] }]
  }
}
```

`report-status.sh` itself is (re)written to `~/.codex-pet/` by the extension
on every activation, so it's always present once the extension has run once
— the hooks above just need to call it. Claude Code pipes the hook's JSON
payload (which includes `session_id`, `cwd`, and for `PreToolUse`,
`tool_name`; for `UserPromptSubmit`, `prompt`) on stdin; the script picks
those up automatically to key each session's file and label the bubble,
unless an explicit label is passed as a third argument (as
`UserPromptSubmit` does with `Thinking`). The first `UserPromptSubmit`'s
`prompt` text is kept as that session's `title` from then on, ignoring later
prompts, so the waiting badge's tooltip stays stable across a conversation.
`end` (`SessionEnd`) deletes that session's file instead of writing a state.

If you installed hooks before this per-session tracking landed, re-run
**Codex Pet: Install Claude Code Hooks...** — the old `Stop`/`SessionEnd`
commands (which reported `idle`) will be recognized as missing and the
current ones added alongside them; remove the stale `idle` lines from
`~/.claude/settings.json` by hand afterward.

## Reacting to GitHub Copilot activity (experimental)

GitHub Copilot Chat has no hooks/lifecycle mechanism like Claude Code's, and
VS Code doesn't yet expose a public API for observing Copilot Chat request
status ([microsoft/vscode#310951](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/310951)
is open but unshipped). So instead of a real signal, adding `copilot` to
`codexPet.aiActivitySources` (on by default) uses a heuristic: bursts of
large or multi-part text-document edits look more like an agent streaming
changes than someone typing key-by-key, so the extension treats those as
"busy" and reports it into `~/.codex-pet/sessions/copilot-copilot.json` (same
status-file protocol as Claude Code above, with a fixed "Copilot" label).
Copilot has no equivalent of Claude Code's `Stop` hook, so it never reports
`waiting` — only `busy`, cleared back to nothing once the edit burst quiets
down.

This is a guess, not a real signal — it can also fire on pastes, snippet
expansion, formatters, find/replace, or other bulk edits from any source, not
just Copilot. Enable it if you want a rough "something is editing a lot"
indicator; leave it off if false positives bother you.

## Adding a pet

Drop a folder under either the bundled `pets/<pet-id>/` (repo-only, ships with
the extension) or, for pets that should stick around across updates, the
folder opened by **Codex Pet: Open Pets Folder**. Each pet folder needs:

- `pet.json` — `{ "id", "displayName", "description", "spritesheetPath", "kind" }`
- the spritesheet file it points to (typically `spritesheet.webp`)

Then run **Codex Pet: Choose Pet...** to pick it up — no reload or code
changes needed, the folders are scanned fresh each time a pet is resolved.

## Settings

| Setting                       | Default | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `codexPet.location`             | `panel` | Where the pet view shows: `panel` (bottom, next to Terminal), `sidebar` (Activity Bar, next to Explorer/Git), or `both` (each location runs its own independent pet). |
| `codexPet.selectedPet`          | `""`    | Pet id or folder name under `pets/` to always load. Empty = last picked pet. Ignored when `selectedPets` is non-empty. |
| `codexPet.selectedPets`         | `[]`    | Pet ids/folder names to show at once, in draw order. Takes precedence over `selectedPet`. Capped by your unlocked slot count (see "Choose Pets..." above); extra entries are ignored. |
| `codexPet.walkSpeed`            | `40`    | Pixels/second while running.                                                  |
| `codexPet.moveChance`           | `0.5`   | Probability (0-1) of starting a move vs. a stationary animation each cycle.   |
| `codexPet.minActionSeconds`     | `3`     | Minimum seconds spent in one action before picking a new one.               |
| `codexPet.maxActionSeconds`     | `10`    | Maximum seconds spent in one action before picking a new one.               |
| `codexPet.idleAnimationSpeed`   | `0.5`   | Speed multiplier for stationary idle animations (idle, wave, jump, waiting, review, failed). Doesn't affect walk/run. |
| `codexPet.idleStateWeights`     | `{}`    | Relative chance of each idle animation being picked, e.g. `{ "wave": 3, "jump": 1 }`. Unlisted states default to weight 1; 0 disables that animation. |
| `codexPet.jumpCooldown`         | `5000`  | Minimum milliseconds between cursor-triggered jumps.                          |
| `codexPet.petScale`             | `1`     | Scale multiplier applied to the pet's sprite size.                            |
| `codexPet.aiActivitySources`    | `["claude-code","copilot"]` | Which AI tools trigger the busy animation + speech bubble: `claude-code`, `copilot` (experimental heuristic), both, or empty to disable. See below. |
| `codexPet.waitingStaleMinutes`  | `15`    | How long (minutes) a Claude Code session can sit in the "waiting for you" state before its badge entry is dropped as stale (crash cleanup only — doesn't affect normal waiting). |
| `codexPet.xpEnabled`            | `true`  | Whether the pet earns XP/levels from coding activity (AI tool activity, editor edits, terminal use, git commits, clicks). Progress (and level) is tracked separately per pet. |
| `codexPet.petGrowthEnabled`     | `true`  | Whether the pet's sprite size grows with its level, from `petGrowthMinScale` at level 1 up to `petGrowthMaxScale` at `petGrowthMaxLevel`. Both are multipliers of `codexPet.petScale`. Requires `xpEnabled`. |
| `codexPet.petGrowthMinScale`    | `0.5`   | Size multiplier at level 1, when growth is enabled. |
| `codexPet.petGrowthMaxScale`    | `1.5`   | Size multiplier at `petGrowthMaxLevel`, when growth is enabled. |
| `codexPet.petGrowthMaxLevel`    | `20`    | Level at which the pet reaches `petGrowthMaxScale`. Growth is linear from level 1, then caps. |
| `codexPet.useNonstandardSprites` | `true` | Use each pet's nonstandard spritesheet and manifest (smoother baked ping-pong loops) instead of the standard Codex-compatible one, when available. See [Nonstandard sprite sheet format](#nonstandard-sprite-sheet-format) below. Renamed from `codexPet.useSeamlessSprites`, which still works as a deprecated alias. |

Timing settings (`walkSpeed`, `moveChance`, `min/maxActionSeconds`) apply live
to an already-open view — no reload needed. Changing `selectedPet` swaps the
pet in the open view immediately too.

## Sprite sheet layout (Codex v2 pet spec)

Every Codex pet spritesheet is a fixed **1536×1872px, 8-column × 9-row** grid
of **192×208px** cells, magenta (`#ff00ff`) color-keyed background, one row
per animation state:

| Row | State        |
|-----|--------------|
| 0   | idle         |
| 1   | running right|
| 2   | running left |
| 3   | waving       |
| 4   | jumping      |
| 5   | failed       |
| 6   | waiting      |
| 7   | running      |
| 8   | review       |

(Grid size and row order per [codexpets.org](https://codexpets.org/install).)
The official Codex app owns frame timing/sequencing itself — pet packages only
ship the manifest and image. Since this extension is its own renderer, that
same grid geometry plus our own per-row frame counts/fps/loop live in
[`media/sprite-config.json`](media/sprite-config.json) (shared across all pets,
not per-pet). Per-row **frame counts** aren't part of the published spec, so
those were eyeballed from the bundled sample sheets under `pets/` (e.g.
`pets/hoggie/spritesheet.webp`) — double check them against a pet's
spritesheet if an animation looks like it's looping into a blank/magenta
frame.

## Nonstandard sprite sheet format

Unlike the standard sheet above, this is **not** part of the published Codex
spec — it's a format this extension's own asset pipeline produces, used only
when `codexPet.useNonstandardSprites` is on and a pet ships one. It exists to
get smoother, hand-tuned animations (variable frame counts per action, baked
loop/ping-pong behavior) than the standard grid's fixed 8-column layout
allows. A pet opts in by shipping both files under
`pets/<pet-id>/nonstandard-seamless/`:

- `spritesheet-seamless.webp` — the atlas image, an arbitrary
  `columns × rows` grid of `cell.width × cell.height` cells (not fixed at
  8×9/192×208 like the standard sheet — read the sizes from the manifest,
  never assume them).
- `spritesheet-seamless.json` — the manifest. Presence of *both* files (each
  is `stat`-checked independently, see [`resolvePets`](src/pets.ts)) is what
  sets a pet's `hasNonstandardVariant` flag; missing either one falls back to
  the standard sheet regardless of the setting.

The renderer ([`normalizeNonstandardConfig`](media/main.js)) only reads a
subset of the manifest — the fields it actually consumes:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `cell.width`, `cell.height` | Pixel size of one grid cell. |
| `actions[].id` | One of the action ids in the table below; unrecognized ids (including all `look-*` direction-pose rows) are ignored. |
| `actions[].rowIndex` | Which atlas row this action's frames live in. |
| `actions[].frameCount` | How many columns (starting at 0) to play. |
| `actions[].fps` | Playback speed for this action. |
| `actions[].loop` | Whether the clip repeats or holds on its last frame. |

`actions[].id` → renderer state, mirroring
[`NONSTANDARD_STATE_IDS`](media/main.js):

| Manifest `id`     | Renderer state |
|--------------------|----------------|
| `idle`              | `idle`     |
| `running-right`     | `runRight` |
| `running-left`      | `runLeft`  |
| `waving`            | `wave`     |
| `jumping`           | `jump`     |
| `failed`            | `failed`   |
| `waiting`           | `waiting`  |
| `running`           | `run`      |
| `review`            | `review`   |

`look-*` action ids (direction poses, not animations — e.g.
`look-000-to-157.5`) are deliberately left unmapped so they never enter the
idle rotation; they're reserved for a future cursor-facing feature that needs
a pose lookup rather than a state.

On-screen size is normalized against the pet's *standard* manifest, not
copied from the nonstandard one: `scale` is derived as
`(standardFrameWidth * standardScale) / cell.width`, so a nonstandard sheet
with a different cell resolution still renders at the same footprint the
standard manifest defines. This means every pet must still ship a standard
`pet.json` + `spritesheet.webp` even when its nonstandard variant is what
actually gets displayed.

That cell-size-based scale assumes each pet's creature fills its cell
proportionally the same, which the generation pipeline's own per-pet size
normalization doesn't guarantee across *different* pets (only within one
pet's own actions, via `sizeNormalization.targetVisibleSize` — see below).
The renderer applies a further correction, scaling by
`REFERENCE_VISIBLE_SIZE / targetVisibleSize` (in `media/main.js`), so pets
whose creature occupies a smaller or larger share of the cell still render
at the same visible height as one another. `REFERENCE_VISIBLE_SIZE` is set
to the visible idle-frame height standard (non-`sizeNormalization`) Codex
pets actually draw at out of their shared 208px-tall cell (measured directly
off installed sheets), since the nonstandard cell size matches the standard
grid's.

Everything else in the manifest — `schemaVersion`, `codexCompatible`,
`sourcePet`/`sourceSpritesheet`, `frameGeneration`, `actions[].frames[]`,
`recommendedRenderer`, `playback`, `idleBehavior`, `sizeNormalization`,
`bottomAlignment`, `artifacts`, `neutralLookFrame`, `timing` — is generation-
pipeline provenance (how the sheet was built from source keyframes, why
frames were chosen, cleanup steps applied) preserved for reference and
regeneration, not read by the extension at runtime.

## Current behavior

- Every `minActionSeconds`-`maxActionSeconds` seconds, randomly either starts
  moving (using the `runRight`/`runLeft` row for the chosen direction) or
  plays a stationary animation picked from `idleStates` (`idle`, `wave`,
  `jump`, `waiting`, `review`, `failed`).
- While moving, walks across the bottom of the view and reverses direction
  at the edges.
- Clicking the pet interrupts whatever it's doing and plays a random
  animation from `reactionStates` (`wave`, `jump` by default, configurable in
  [`media/sprite-config.json`](media/sprite-config.json)) for a fixed ~1.2s,
  with a small heart particle popping up as feedback, then resumes normal
  idle/walk behavior.
- While the cursor is anywhere over the view, every shown pet runs toward it
  horizontally instead of wandering randomly, queuing up side by side rather
  than stacking, and settles into idle once it's underneath. If the cursor
  stops roughly above a pet, that pet jumps to try to reach it (on its own
  ~1.2s cooldown so it doesn't jump nonstop). Moving the cursor off the view
  resumes normal random idle/walk behavior for all of them.
- Each pet earns XP (and levels shown as a small badge on its sprite) from
  active coding: a git commit is a flat one-off bonus to every shown pet, and
  clicking a pet gives it a small rate-limited bonus. Active-minute XP (AI-tool
  activity, editor edits, terminal use) is a shared pool across however many
  pets are shown — it grows sublinearly with pet count (showing more pets
  earns more total XP, but not proportionally more) and splits with catch-up
  weighting so a lower-level pet in the group gets a bigger share. Leveling up
  plays a jump + heart celebration. Progress persists per pet across restarts
  and updates; disable with `codexPet.xpEnabled`. Optionally
  (`codexPet.petGrowthEnabled`, on by default), the pet's sprite size grows
  with its level too, from a smaller starting size up to 1.5x the configured
  scale — and once a pet reaches `codexPet.petGrowthMaxLevel`, it gets a
  golden badge outline and a slow sparkle aura, so leveling further still has
  a visible payoff after size growth caps out.
- On top of the active-minute pool, a few multipliers reward showing up
  regularly and sticking around, all additive and applied before the
  per-pet split:
  - **Daily streak**: +10% per consecutive weekday (Mon–Fri) you're active,
    capping at +100% on day 10. Weekends don't advance or break it — it's
    neutral, not required and not penalized. Missing a single weekday is
    forgiven (e.g. active Thu, off Fri, active Mon → streak intact); missing
    two weekdays in a row resets it.
  - **Session streak**: +10% per 30 continuous active minutes in one
    sitting, capping at +100% at 5 hours. A gap of up to 30 minutes just
    pauses the clock (it doesn't reset); a gap over 90 minutes resets it to
    zero.
  - **Weekend bonus**: flat +20% for any active minute on Sat/Sun.
  - **Late-night bonus**: flat +20% for any active minute between 10pm and
    6am local time, any day.
  
  These stack freely (no combined ceiling) — commit XP and click XP are
  unaffected either way.

## Privacy & Security

Codex Pet makes no network requests — no analytics, telemetry, or
third-party services, and no runtime dependencies at all. Everything it does
stays on your machine:

- **AI activity tracking** (see above) only reads event *metadata* — tool
  names, timestamps, and the first ~20 characters of your first prompt per
  session (kept as a stable label for the waiting-badge tooltip). It never
  reads file contents, git commit messages/diffs, or terminal output.
- **Status files** for in-progress AI sessions live at
  `~/.codex-pet/sessions/*.json` and are deleted when a session ends (or
  after the configured staleness window).
- **XP/level/streak progress** is stored in this extension's own VS Code
  global storage (`xp.json`, `streak.json`), plus a couple of small flags in
  VS Code's `globalState` (last-selected pet(s), whether you've dismissed the
  hooks-install prompt).
- **Claude Code hooks**: installing them (via the command, or the one-time
  prompt on activation) edits `~/.claude/settings.json` to add a few lines
  that shell out to `~/.codex-pet/report-status.sh`. That script is written
  to disk by the extension but only ever executed by Claude Code's own hook
  mechanism, never by the extension itself — and nothing is installed
  without your explicit confirmation in the dialog first.
- The extension never spawns subprocesses or execs external commands itself.

To remove all of Codex Pet's data, delete `~/.codex-pet/` and uninstall the
extension (VS Code cleans up its own global storage automatically).

## Development

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for building and running from
source, and packaging/installing a local `.vsix`.

## Not implemented (see vscode-pets for reference if you want these later)

- Persisting pet position/state across window reloads
- Sound effects, throw-ball
- Reacting to Codex CLI activity (Claude Code is wired up via real hooks, and
  Copilot has an experimental heuristic — see the sections above).
  `waiting`/`failed` are still just triggered randomly for variety.
